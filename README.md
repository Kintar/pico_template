# Raspberry Pi Pico Template Project

A quick-and-dirty template project for development on the Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico_W.

Rename the project and set the target board in `project.cmake`.

By default, this project only includes the pico_stdlib aggregate. Additional libraries can be included
by modifying `pico_link_libs.cmake`.
